# M2 forwarded operation ledger

The Rust registry owns only the operations listed as native below. `PACER_FORWARD_OPS` can return any native operation to the TypeScript core. The TypeScript handlers remain the reference during M2.

| Operation | M2 P3-D route | Retained TypeScript caller or reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `activity.list` | Native | `src/api/ops.ts` is the forward fallback; `src/core/task-detail.ts` reads the same activity log. |
| `task.log` | Native | `src/api/ops.ts` is the forward fallback; `src/api/http.ts` uses it for follow mode SSE. |
| `task.dismiss` | Forwarded | Needs linked activity publication, task event and cleanup. The P3-B publisher from #553 is absent from this base. |
| `task.diff` | Forwarded | Needs the full git argv, snapshot fallback and file tree parity fixture. |
| `task.get`, `task.list`, `task.prune`, `task.restore` | Forwarded | Queue/lifecycle and retention behavior belong to later cutovers. |

The native `activity.list` reads the TypeScript activity JSONL, and `task.log` reads the shared SQLite task record and output files. `task.log` opens the existing adapter, which may import or migrate the store as described in P3-C. This slice does not move the `/v3/tasks/<id>/log?follow=1` SSE route or any `/v2` route.
