# U3 settings screens

Import `screens/settings/index` explicitly. This barrel exports the U3 screens mounted by the shell. Every settings route loads through `LazySettings`, so none of these screens counts toward `app.js`.

| Route | Component |
| --- | --- |
| `#/settings` | `SettingsGeneral` (Overview) |
| `#/settings/<section>` | `SettingsGeneral section={section}` (only the selected editor mounts) |
| `#/settings/executors` | Agents, Executors tab (`ExecutorsSection`) |
| `#/settings/accounts` | Agents, Accounts tab (`AccountsSection`) |
| `#/settings/add-executor` | Add agent wizard (`AddExecutor`); `?host=<alias>` prefills the host |
| `#/settings/machine` | Machines: This machine, guided Add remote host (`AddHost`), host list |
| `#/settings/hosts` | Machines (same page) |
| `#/settings/hosts/<alias>` | `HostDetail alias={alias}` |

The Accounts tab, Add agent and host detail are part of the Agents and Machines menu entries (`settingsPageId` maps them). The screens register their token-based constructed stylesheet on mount; the shared build and stylesheet need no edits. `initialData` is optional preloaded data for rendering before requests complete. The API remains authoritative after mounting.

Jobs use store events plus `job.get` polling. Host detail also recovers retained jobs with `job.list`. The Add agent draft preserves the service-returned id and job id across reloads. Host detail shows the Full live sessions switch only when `host.get` returns a `session` field; it sends `host.set` with `session: 'full' | 'recording'`.

Settings category metadata lives in `app/src/settings-pages.ts`; the shell owns the single page title. Settings forms use DS `settings` density (32px) and small table actions use 28px; narrow layouts retain touch targets.
